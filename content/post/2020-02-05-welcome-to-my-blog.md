Hi there, I just created this blog to showcase my data science projects. This is my first ever blog post!
<!--more-->

## Who am I?

My name is Alix, I'm French and live in London. That's pretty much it really.


## What do I do?

I study Applied Social Data Science (MSc) at the London School of Economics and before that, I studied a BSc in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at University College London. 

I'm also the co-founder of ethi, a personal data start-up that you can learn more about here: http://ethi.webflow.io.


## What will this blog be about?

Mainly about data. I like to explore the intersection between data science and social science, in particular: 

* Social Data Science

* Political Behaviour and Public Policy

* Machine Learning and Personal Data Ethics


That's it for now!
